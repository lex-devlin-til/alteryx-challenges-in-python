A client requested assistance with retrieving the history of a customerâ€™s end-of-day currency balances from a given dataset. The goal is to display these daily balances in an output table, with the oldest balances on the left and the most recent on the right.

Your challenge is to find a solution that ensures the daily balances are always displayed in the correct chronological order, from the oldest (left) to the most recent (right).
